Repository for all aspects of a project that aims to test a methodological approach to price prediction on the dutch electricity balancing market. The primary aim is to develop a series of contexts, clustered on a variety of meta-features, in which models are developed that perform better than a generic model on subsets of the feature space. 

The repository is still in a rough form, and the stages of the project, from data collection + processing, meta-feature discovery, to model training and testing are not yet finalised.
