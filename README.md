# Thesis

Working repository for all aspects of the thesis - a project that aims to test a methodological approach to price prediction on tne dutch electricity balancing market. The primary aim is to develop a series of contexts, clustered on a variety of meta-features, in which models are developed that perform better than a generic model on subsets of the feature space. 

The repository is still in a rough form, and the stages of the project, from data collection + processing, meta-feature discovery, to model training and testing are not yet finalised. However, the scripts that form the majority of these tasks can be browsed in the 'scripts' folder, and the data that underpins all of these scripts is stored as pickled in the various other data folders.
